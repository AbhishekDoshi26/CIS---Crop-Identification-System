<p>This project contains an app that can be used by farmers and also the agriculture students <br> 
  to get information about various crops and plants that are grown in India.<br>
  The information displayed will be:
  <ul>
    <li>Scientific Name</li>
    <li>Water Required</li>
    <li>Soil Type</li>
    <li>Time Required</li>
